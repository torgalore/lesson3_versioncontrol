            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Version control is a system that keeps records of a file or set of files, making it possible to go back and review specific versions later. This gives you the ability to go back and revert files back to a previous state and compare changes over time. When working in a group for coding a project, this can also be helpful by letting you see you last modified something that might be causing a problem, or who introduced an issue and when. Also, if files are lost or corrupted, you are able to easily recover them.    </div>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has a similar interface to most version control systems, but stores and thinks about information much differently. The main difference between Git and other VCS is the way it thinks about data. Git thinks of its data like a set of snapshots of a miniature file system, where as most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes, thinking of the information as a set of files and changes made to each file over time. Every time a project is saved in Git, it takes a snapshot of what all your files look like and stores a reference. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has three main states that files exist in: committed, modified, and staged. Committed means the data is stored safely in a local database. Modified means that the files changed, but has not been committed it to the database. Staged means the modified file is marked in its current version to go into the next commit snapshot. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The three states lead us into the three main sections of a Git project: the Git directory, the working directory, and the staging area. The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for a project. It’s the most important part and is what is copied when cloning a repository from another computer. The working directory is where the files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on a disk for use or modification. The staging area, often referred to as the index, is a file that stores information about what will go into the next commit. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Changes to the Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Each file in a working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or untracked. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. Untracked files are everything else – any files in a working directory that were not in the last snapshot and are not in the staging area. When first cloning a repository, all of the files will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and they haven’t been edited. As the files are edited, Git sees them as modified, because they’ve been changed since the last commit. These modified files are staged, committed, and the cycle repeats. </p>
